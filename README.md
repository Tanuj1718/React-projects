                          PROJECT-1: Accordion
Summary:
-> Made a simple api which contains id, questions and answers.
-> On clicking question, we get answer of that question through its id. If we click on the another question , then the current answer will be hidden.
-> Further modified by using 'enable multiple selection' button to show every answer on clicking.

-> used useState hooks for the following purposes:
1. to show individual text on each click. Used singleSelection method.
2. to show every text on each click. Used multipleSelection method.
